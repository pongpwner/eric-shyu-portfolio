      My name is Eric Shyu, I am from North Carolina. I am a front end developer
      with a Computer Science degree from UNC Chapel Hill. Since graduation I
      have been working on various projects and taking online courses to gain
      experience and further my knowledge on front end development.

      I grew up using the internet and I have enjoyed seeing the ui/ux of
      websites I use evolve. One of my favorite websites is youtube. I have been
      a frequent user of the site since 2005, and I have seen the many changes
      it has gone through. It started out unpolished , but now the ux/ui is so
      clean. I can also certainly remember experiences where navigating a
      website was counterintuitive. It is a shame when a website is not easy to
      navigate. I love the internet and I want to contribute to it by creating
      beautiful websites with a great user experience.

      Coding aside I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, exercising, and
      trying new hobbies. I dabble in yoyoing, drawing, piano, pen spinning,
      breakdancing, balisong, diabolo, kendama, and juggling.
