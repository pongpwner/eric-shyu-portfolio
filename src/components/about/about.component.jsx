    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Eric Shyu, 23 years old, and I am from North Carolina. I am a
      front end developer with a computer science degree from UNC Chapel Hill.
      Since graduation I have been working on various projects and taking online
      courses to gain experience and further my knowledge on front end
      development. You can find some of the projects I have been working on in
      the “Projects” section. Currently, I am seeking a role as a front end
      developer.

      I grew up using the internet and I have enjoyed seeing the ui/ux of
      websites I use evolve. I can certainly remember experiences where
      navigating a website was counterintuitive. I love the internet and I want
      to contribute to it by creating beautiful websites with a great user
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am just starting out my career, and I am excited to learn more and to
      see what the future holds.
