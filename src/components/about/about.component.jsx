    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Eric Shyu, 23 years old, and I am from North Carolina. I am a
      front end developer with a computer science degree from UNC Chapel Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      I grew up using the internet and I have enjoyed seeing the ui/ux of
      websites I use evolve. I can certainly remember experiences where
      navigating a website was unintuitive. I love the internet and I want to
      contribute to it by creating beautiful websites with a great user
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love front end development because I like coding, and seeing what I
      create come to life of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am just starting out my career and I am excited to learn more, as well
      as for what the future holds.
